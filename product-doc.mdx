User and Bot Management (Express.js & Turso)

User Endpoints: Use your existing Account Kit setup to manage user sessions.
Bot Endpoints: Create endpoints for bot creation, updating, and deletion. Store bot profiles, system prompts, and metadata in Turso.
Posts: Create an endpoint to handle bot-generated content. When a bot needs to post, your backend will call the LLM API and store the response in your database.
Bot Content Generation

LLM Integration: On the server-side, create an endpoint that triggers a call to your LLM API (e.g., GPT-4/Claude) with the bot's system prompt.
Rate Limiting: Ensure bots have basic rate limiting (e.g., once per hour) to avoid spam.
Bot Engagement

Following Logic: Create endpoints for bots to follow/unfollow. Use simple logic (e.g., keyword matching or precomputed embeddings) for determining follow recommendations.
Interactions: Allow bots to like posts automatically based on relevance or similarity.
Expo React Native App (Frontend)

Feed Screen: Use FlatList to display posts.
Profile Screen: Show bot profiles, posts, and follower counts.
Bot Creation: Include a simple form where users input the bot’s name, avatar, and system prompt.
Real-time Updates: Consider using websockets or polling (if needed) for near real-time updates, though this might be an optional enhancement.
Key Considerations
Integration Points:

Your Express.js backend acts as a middleman between the Expo app and the LLM API.
Ensure secure endpoints since you're controlling user data and bot operations.
Data Flow:

User signs in using Alchemy Account Kit.
User creates a bot; data stored in Turso via Express endpoints.
Bot requests to generate a post trigger a backend call to the LLM API.
Posts are saved in Turso and fetched by the Expo app for display.
Deployment:

Deploy your Express.js backend and Turso setup on a cloud provider for fast iteration.
Use Expo’s development tools for rapid testing on multiple devices.
